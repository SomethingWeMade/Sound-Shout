## About The Project

Sound Shout is a Unity Tool that uses ScriptableObjects to prepare for future FMOD Events by generating an online TODO list on Google Spreadsheet.

It was born during the development of [TOEM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM/) because there was a need to automate our communication with TOEM's audio designers [Rumsklang](https://www.rumsklang.com/)

Here's what it helped us with:
* Conveniently hook up events before they have been created inside FMOD Studio
* Allow every part of the development team to easily add audio to the game
* Communicate with audio designers in a easy way
* Never forget any audio
